**Personal Portfolio Website**

This is a responsive personal portfolio website built using HTML and CSS. The project showcases my profile, skills, projects, and contact information in a clean and structured layout. It is designed to provide a clear overview of my background and technical abilities while following modern web design principles.

The website focuses on semantic HTML, CSS styling, and layout techniques such as Flexbox to ensure proper alignment and responsiveness across different screen sizes. This project helped me strengthen my understanding of front-end fundamentals, page structure, and visual design.
